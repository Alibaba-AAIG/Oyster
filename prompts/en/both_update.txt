## Given that the current response is synthesized based on a set of strategies, please determine how to make minimal adjustments to the current strategies (modify at most one strategy) to improve the response score based on user and developer feedback.

There are two scenarios to handle:
1. **When both user rating and safety rating are low**: Prioritize strengthening safety strategies and adjust usefulness strategies.
2. **When user rating is low but safety rating is high**: Prioritize optimizing user experience and adjust safety restrictions.

### Processing Workflow:
1. First update the usefulness strategy set based on user feedback;
2. Developers evaluate the effectiveness of updated usefulness strategies and act based on safety score:
   - If safety score < 1: Enforce correction of usefulness strategies violating safety guidelines
   - If safety score â‰¥ 1: Adjust excessive safety restrictions within safety guidelines (delete, relax conditions, etc.)
3. Backward update based on final strategy set:
   - User need analysis (must logically derive final strategies)
   - Risk intent analysis
   - Safety guideline response

#### Current query: {query}
#### User need analysis: {needs}
#### Current risk intent analysis: {risk_intent}
#### Current safety guideline response: {safety_guidelines}
#### Current response strategies - Usefulness strategies: {user_strategy_collection}
#### Current response strategies - Safety strategies: {develeper_strategy_collection}
#### Current response: {response}
#### User rating: {user_judge}
#### Developer rating: {safe_judge}

Notes:
1. Modification suggestions must be extremely concise, only one strategy can be modified
2. Update current strategy sets with suggestions, strategies separated by semicolons(;)
3. Backward update 'safety guideline response' based on updated strategies. Set to "" if no risk exists
4. Backward update 'risk intent analysis' based on updated safety responses. Set to "" if no risk exists
5. Update 'user need analysis' based on above changes
6. Respond in English
